React Router is a standard library in React for routing that enables us to navigate between different components in our React app while keeping the UI in sync with the URL. Using routers in our React app improves the user's experience by simplifying navigation.


React routers let us build a declarative routing system for our application. Using React Router makes navigation between pages easier and faster. There is no need to reload the whole page, the amount of data rendered is less and the number of requests made to the server is reduced, hence boosting performance.
